Financial Markets Overview

Purpose

	Match lenders with borrowers.
	Facilitate capital flow, investment, and risk management.

Evolution

	Barter system → Centralized exchanges → Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs)
	OTC (Over-the-Counter) trades: customized, bilateral agreements

Types of Instruments

	Equities (Stocks)

		IPO = Primary Market
		Trading post-IPO = Secondary Market

	Debt

		Loans and Bonds
		Issuers: Governments, Corporates, Universities

	Commodities: Metals, Energy, Agriculture (traded via futures, sometimes physical delivery)

	Real Estate: Involves mortgages, asset-backed securities (ABS)

	Derivatives: Options, Swaps, Structured Products

		Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from the price of an underlying asset. 
		They are used to hedge risk, speculate on price movements, or gain access to otherwise hard-to-trade assets or markets.
		Types of Derivatives:

		1. Forward Contract
			Agreement to buy/sell an asset at a future date at a fixed price.
			Private, customizable, over-the-counter (OTC).

			Example: You agree to buy a bike for $500 in 3 months.

		2. Futures Contract
			Standardized version of a forward contract, traded on exchanges.

			Example: Buy 100 barrels of oil at $80 each for delivery in 6 months.

		3. Options Contract
		Gives the right, but not obligation to buy/sell an asset at a set price on a future date.
		Two main types:
		Call Option: Right to buy
		Put Option: Right to sell
		Comes with a premium (cost to acquire the option).

		4. Swaps (Not covered in the video but part of the main 4)
		Agreements to exchange cash flows (e.g., fixed rate for floating rate).

		Key Concepts:

			Strike Price: Agreed price in the derivative.
			Maturity Date: When the contract settles.
			Premium: Upfront cost for options.
			Leverage: Small price changes in underlying cause large changes in derivative value.

		Use Cases:

		Cost Hedging: E.g., Airlines hedge fuel costs with futures.
		Speculation: Bet on price movements without owning the asset.
		Arbitrage: Profit from mispricing between markets.

		Risks:
		Can be extremely complex and opaque.
		Used irresponsibly, can lead to massive losses.
		Systemic risk when used by institutions with borrowed funds.

Key Financial Terminologies

	Volatility: Standard deviation of price change.
	
	Vega (Kappa): Sensitivity to volatility (not a Greek letter, but widely used).

	Greeks:

		Delta: Sensitivity to underlying asset
		Gamma: Sensitivity of delta (2nd derivative)
		Theta: Time decay
		Vega: Sensitivity to volatility

	VaR (Value at Risk): Quantifies potential loss in a portfolio.

	Alpha: Excess return vs benchmark

	Beta: Correlation with market index (e.g., S&P 500)

Mathematical Applications

	Pricing Models

		Solve differential equations (e.g., Black-Scholes)
		Monte Carlo simulations

	Risk Management

		Quantify exposure, balance sheet management

	Trading Strategies

		Directional (long/short)

		Arbitrage

		Value trading (fundamental/relative)

		Systematic (trend, momentum, statistical arbitrage)

		Example: Kalman Filter for FX trading

Market Participants

	Banks

		Commercial: Deposits and loans
		Investment: Capital markets, M&A, IPO

	Dealers vs. Brokers

		Dealers: Market makers, take principal risk
		Brokers: Match trades, earn commission

	Funds

		Mutual Funds, Pension Funds, Endowments

	Hedge Funds: Exploit inefficiencies, take risks

	Private Equity: Invest in companies, improve profitability

	Governments: Set monetary policy, regulate markets

Human Behavior in Finance

	Risk Aversion

		People often avoid locking in losses
		Prefer certainty even if mathematically suboptimal

	Decision-making Biases

		Short memory of past crises
		Over-simplification of models

	Judgment vs. Math: Finance combines both rigor and intuition


Insights

	People tend to extrapolate recent history, but market cycles are long.
	You might build a perfect model, but markets will change. Keep adapting.
