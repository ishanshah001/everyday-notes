# Crashes and Crises

## Overview

- We explore **hyperinflation**, **recession**, **depression**, and **stagflation**.
- These are **extreme economic situations** with devastating effects.
- Understanding them is key for avoiding policy mistakes if you ever find yourself running an economy.

## Hyperinflation

### What Is It?
- Extremely rapid price increases — usually **50%+ inflation per month**.
- Money loses value fast; people stop saving and rush to spend.

### Historical Examples:
#### **Weimar Germany (1923)**:
- Printed Marks to pay WWI reparations.
- Result: 1 USD = **1 trillion marks**.
- People burned money for fuel and used it as wallpaper.

#### **Zimbabwe (2007–2008)**:
- Annual inflation rate: **489 billion %**.
- $100 trillion notes were printed.
- Prices doubled every 24 hours.

#### **Hungary (1946)**:
- Worst in history: Prices rose by a factor of **3 × 10²⁵**.

### Causes:
1. Governments printed money to cover debts.
2. Initially, inflation rose gradually.
3. People expected higher prices and spent faster.
4. This increased the **velocity of money**, leading to runaway inflation.

> **Velocity of Money**: How often a unit of currency is spent in a given period.  
> High velocity = faster inflation.

### How It Ended:
- **Germany**: Replaced old currency.
- **Zimbabwe**: Abandoned local currency, adopted foreign ones like the USD.

## Recession vs Depression

### Recession
- A period of **declining real GDP** for at least two consecutive quarters.
- Usually shorter and less severe than a depression.

### Depression
- A **prolonged and severe recession** with:
  - Massive unemployment
  - Sharp decline in income
  - Falling prices

#### The Great Depression (1929–1939):
- Triggered by the 1929 stock market crash.
- U.S. GDP collapsed; **unemployment hit 25%**.
- **Average family income fell 40%**.
- Deflation made borrowing unappealing despite zero interest rates.
- Recovery didn’t fully occur until **WWII spending**.

### Liquidity Trap:
- Interest rates at or near 0%.
- People and businesses still **don’t borrow or spend** due to falling prices.
- Causes deflationary spiral:
  > Falling prices → Delayed spending → Less demand → More price drops

## Stagflation

### Definition:
- A rare combo: **Stagnant economic growth + Inflation**.

### Example: U.S. in the 1970s
- Triggered by **supply shocks**:
  - Oil embargoes
  - Collapse in supply of inputs (e.g., Peruvian anchovies for fertilizer)
- Productivity fell while prices rose.

### Policy Missteps:
- The Fed **increased the money supply** to stimulate growth.
- But **output didn’t rise**, so it only fueled more inflation.

### Paul Volcker’s Response:
- Became Fed Chair in early 1980s.
- **Cut the money supply**, raised interest rates sharply.
- Result:
  - Recession deepened temporarily
  - Inflation expectations were broken
  - Economy stabilized

## Key Takeaways

- **Hyperinflation** ruins currencies and economies.
- **Deflation** during depressions discourages spending and borrowing.
- **Stagflation** is especially hard to fix because fixing inflation can worsen unemployment.
- **Expectations matter**: People's beliefs about prices and policy shape real outcomes.
- **Confidence and policy credibility** are essential.
