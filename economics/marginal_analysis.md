# Marginal Analysis & Elasticity

## Microeconomics Overview
- Microeconomics = decision-making of individuals, firms, and governments.
- Looks at **individual markets** (vs macroeconomics which focuses on the economy as a whole).
- Core questions:
  - How many workers should be hired?
  - Why are some goods expensive?
  - How do individuals/companies make economic choices?

## Marginal Analysis

### What is it?
- "Marginal" = **additional**
- Marginal analysis compares **additional benefit** vs **additional cost** of an action.
- Used by consumers, businesses, and governments.

### Example: Hiring Workers
- Compare **marginal revenue** generated by the worker vs **marginal cost** (wages + benefits).
- If revenue > cost → hire the worker.

### Example: Building Parks
- Government compares:
  - Additional satisfaction (utility) from new park
  - vs cost (land, tax money).
- Stop when **marginal cost > marginal benefit**.

## Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility

- Utility = satisfaction.
- **Diminishing marginal utility** = Each additional unit of a good provides **less additional satisfaction**.
- First slice of pizza = amazing, fifth = meh.
- Economists use **utils** (imaginary units of happiness) to quantify satisfaction.

## Thought Bubble Example: Amusement Park
- Stan evaluates:
  - Utility from rides vs wait times.
- Even the best ride (high utility) might not be worth a long wait.
- Also applies to pricing:
  - Firms offer **discounts for later purchases** because marginal utility drops.

## Supply & Demand Refresher (with Marginal View)

### Demand Curve
- Downward sloping due to:
  - **Law of Demand**: Higher price → lower quantity demanded.
  - **Diminishing Marginal Utility**: More consumed → less satisfaction → lower willingness to pay.
- Demand curve = **Marginal Benefit Curve**.

### Supply Curve
- Upward sloping due to:
  - **Law of Supply**: Higher price → more production.
- Supply curve = **Marginal Cost Curve**.

### Market Equilibrium
- **Efficient** outcome occurs where:
  - **Marginal Benefit = Marginal Cost**
- Too few goods → MB > MC → produce more.
- Too many goods → MC > MB → reduce production.

## The Diamond-Water Paradox

- Water = essential, but cheap.
- Diamonds = not essential, but expensive.

**Explanation:**
- **Total utility** of water is high.
- But **marginal utility** is low because it's abundant.
- Diamonds are **scarce**, so marginal utility (and price) is high.
- Scarcity + consumer preferences → high value.

## Substitutes & Demand

- **Substitution effect**: If the price of a good rises, consumers switch to substitutes.
- Demand for goods with many substitutes is **more elastic**.

---

## Elasticity of Demand

### What is it?
- Measures **sensitivity of quantity demanded** to a price change.

### Elasticity Types:
- **Elastic demand**: Small price change → large quantity change.
  - Example: Pizza (many substitutes).
- **Inelastic demand**: Price change → small quantity change.
  - Example: Gasoline, coffee, healthcare.
- **Perfectly inelastic demand**: Quantity does not change at all.
  - Example: Insulin for diabetics.

### Demand Curve Shapes:
- **Elastic** → flatter
- **Inelastic** → steeper

---

## Elasticity of Supply

- Measures **sensitivity of quantity supplied** to price change.

### Supply Types:
- **Relatively elastic**: Producers can respond quickly.
  - Example: T-shirts, strawberries.
- **Relatively inelastic**: Hard to increase production quickly.
  - Example: Airplanes.
- **Perfectly inelastic**: Supply is fixed.
  - Example: Van Gogh paintings (he’s not painting anymore).

---

## Conclusion

- **Marginal analysis** and **elasticity** help explain everyday decisions and market behavior.
- These tools improve how we understand pricing, production, and consumption.
- You already use marginal thinking unconsciously—now you can apply it more effectively.
