What is Macroeconomics?

## üéØ Goals of Macroeconomics
Macroeconomics = Study of the **entire economy**, including:
- National income
- GDP (Gross Domestic Product)
- Unemployment
- Inflation
- Government policies

Economists have **3 main goals**:
1. **Economic growth**
2. **Low unemployment**
3. **Stable prices**

## üìä 1. Economic Growth: Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

### What is GDP?
- **GDP** = Total **market value** of all **final goods and services** produced within a country in a given year.
- **Used items**, **financial assets**, and **illegal activity** are **not included**.
- Focus is on **final goods** (not intermediate goods).

### Nominal vs Real GDP
- **Nominal GDP**: Not adjusted for inflation.
- **Real GDP**: Adjusted for inflation ‚Üí better indicator of economic health.

### Measuring Recessions
- **Recession** = 2 consecutive quarters (6 months) of decreasing real GDP.
- **Depression** = Severe, prolonged recession (no official definition).

> Example: Greece (2008‚Äì2014) experienced a long recession with falling Real GDP.

## üíº 2. Unemployment

### Definition:
- **Unemployment Rate** = (Unemployed / Labor Force) √ó 100
- Labor force = Working-age individuals actively working or looking for work.

### Limitations:
- **Discouraged workers**: Not counted as unemployed.
- **Underemployed workers**: Counted as employed even if working below their potential.

### Types of Unemployment:
1. **Frictional** ‚Äì Between jobs or entering the labor force.
2. **Structural** ‚Äì Skills mismatch or technological change (e.g., VCR repair).
3. **Cyclical** ‚Äì Due to recession and reduced demand.

**Goal**: Achieve **natural rate of unemployment** (only frictional + structural; ~4‚Äì6%).

## üìâ 3. Stable Prices: Inflation

### What is Inflation?
- Measured by changes in prices of a **market basket** of commonly purchased goods.
- **Inflation Rate** = % change in market basket over time.

### Why is Inflation a Problem?
- Decreases **purchasing power**.
- Raises **interest rates**, wages, business costs.

### Deflation:
- Falling prices ‚Üí Consumers delay spending ‚Üí Lower demand ‚Üí Lower GDP ‚Üí Higher unemployment.
- **Deflation = Bad** (often tied to recessions).

## üîÑ The Business Cycle

Visualize economy as a **car**:
- **Expansion**: Rising GDP, falling unemployment, increasing inflation.
- **Peak**: Economy overheating.
- **Contraction**: Falling GDP, rising unemployment.
- **Trough**: Economy stabilizes ‚Üí Recovery begins.

### Four Components of GDP (Engine of Economy):
1. **C** ‚Äì Consumer Spending
2. **I** ‚Äì Investment (business spending)
3. **G** ‚Äì Government Spending
4. **NX** ‚Äì Net Exports (Exports - Imports)

> US Economy = ~70% consumer spending.

## üõ†Ô∏è Policy & Government Role

- Governments can **stimulate** or **slow** the economy:
  - Cut taxes or increase spending during recession.
- Drawback = Debt.
- Debate exists about how much intervention is appropriate.

## üß† Final Thoughts

- Macroeconomic indicators (GDP, unemployment, inflation) provide an **overview**, but they don't tell the **full story**.
- Human behavior makes predictions complex.
- Macroeconomics helps us become better decision-makers by understanding how the **whole economy works**.
