# Market Failures and Government Intervention

## Overview
- Free markets are efficient most of the time.
- But sometimes, **markets fail** to allocate resources properly.
- These are known as **market failures**.
- Governments step in to correct these failures.

---

## What Are Market Failures?

- A **market failure** occurs when the market fails to produce or allocate goods and services efficiently.
- This can lead to:
  - **Underproduction** of essential goods
  - **Overproduction** of harmful goods
  - **Free riders**
  - **Environmental degradation**
  - **Public goods not being provided**

---

## 1. Free Rider Problem

### Definition:
- **Free riders** benefit from goods or services **without paying for them**.

### Example:
- Public fire department: If citizens could choose to pay \$20 or \$100, many would choose $20.
  - If >50% choose $20, the fire department is underfunded.
- Result: Everyone suffers, even those who paid more.

### Government Response:
- Fund essential services (fire, police, military, education) through **mandatory taxation**.
- These goods are considered **non-optional** for a functioning society.

---

## 2. Public Goods

### Characteristics:
1. **Non-excludable**: Cannot exclude anyone from using it.
2. **Non-rival**: One person's use doesn't reduce availability to others.

### Examples:
- National defense
- Public parks
- Street lighting
- Disease prevention

### Market Failure:
- Private companies have **no incentive** to produce public goods.
- Government steps in to provide and fund them.

## 3. Tragedy of the Commons

### Definition:
- When **common resources** (air, oceans, forests) are overused and depleted because:
  - Individuals act in **self-interest**
  - They cannot be **excluded** from use

### Examples:
- Overfishing
- Deforestation
- Air and water pollution
- Endangered species hunted

### Why It Happens:
- If I conserve, others will exploit.
- Therefore, **everyone overuses**, resulting in long-term harm.

### Subfield:
- **Environmental Economics** studies and addresses these issues.

---

## 4. Externalities

### Definition:
- Costs or benefits of a market activity that **affect third parties** outside the market.

### Types:
1. **Negative Externality**: Harms others  
   - Example: Factory pollutes a river
2. **Positive Externality**: Benefits others  
   - Example: Your education benefits society

### Problem:
- Market prices don't reflect externalities.
- Leads to **overproduction** (negative) or **underproduction** (positive).

### Government Role:
- **Tax negative externalities** (e.g., pollution, smoking)
- **Subsidize positive externalities** (e.g., education, green tech)

---

## 5. Regulatory Policies

### Definition:
- Government creates **rules or restrictions** to correct behavior.

### Examples:
- Pollution limits
- Safety standards
- Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations

### Regulation Goals:
- Reduce harm (e.g., pollution)
- Promote positive outcomes (e.g., compulsory education)

### Debate:
- How much regulation is enough?
- Most agree on regulating extreme cases (e.g., nuclear weapons)

---

## 6. Market-Based Policies

### Definition:
- Use **incentives and prices** to influence market behavior.

### Tools:
- **Taxes** on negative externalities (e.g., cigarette taxes)
- **Subsidies** for positive externalities (e.g., Pell Grants)

### Benefits:
- Internalizes external costs
- Generates government revenue (taxes)
- Less need for enforcement compared to regulation

---

## 7. Cap and Trade

### How It Works:
- Government **caps** total emissions and **issues permits**
- Companies **trade** permits
- Clean firms profit by selling unused permits

### Advantages:
- Market-driven
- Creates incentive to reduce pollution

### Example:
- US **Acid Rain Program** (sulfur dioxide reduction)
  - Benefits > costs by 40:1

---

## 8. Global Market Failures

### Example: Climate Change
- **Tragedy of the Commons** at a global scale
- Countries benefit from polluting but share climate consequences

### Problem:
- One country's reduction doesn't prevent others from polluting
- Global cooperation required (hard to achieve due to trust issues)

## Conclusion

- **Markets aren't perfect**, and sometimes they fail.
- **Government intervention** is necessary when:
  - Public goods aren't provided
  - Externalities distort markets
  - Common resources are overused
  - Free riders undermine essential services

- The real question is:
  - Not **"market or government?"**
  - But **"how can they work together?"** to improve welfare and efficiency.
