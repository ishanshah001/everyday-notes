# How Companies Make Money

## Overview
- **How businesses operate**, **earn profits**, and **make decisions** using economic principles.
- Key focus areas:
  - Revenue vs. Profit
  - Types of Costs
  - Pricing and Production Decisions
  - Economies of Scale
  - Marginal Analysis
  - Sunk Costs

## Profit, Revenue, and Opportunity Cost

### 1. Revenue
- **Total Revenue** = Total income from sales.

### 2. Profit
- **Accounting Profit** = Revenue - Explicit Costs (e.g., rent, wages, materials)
- **Economic Profit** = Revenue - (Explicit Costs + Implicit Costs)
  - **Implicit Costs** = Opportunity cost of using resources elsewhere.
  - Example: Lawyer opens a pizza shop and earns \$30,000 profit, but loses \$100,000 he would’ve earned practicing law → **Economic Loss of $70,000**

---

## Business Decision-Making

- Businesses weigh **explicit + implicit costs** to make rational choices.
- Like individuals, they ask:
  - Is the **benefit** worth the **opportunity cost**?

---

## Competitive Markets and Profit

- In highly **competitive markets**, economic profit tends to fall to **zero**.
  - This is called **normal profit** — just enough to justify staying in business.
- High profits attract **new competitors**, which **reduces prices** and **erodes profit margins**.

---

## Costs of Production

### Types of Costs:
- **Fixed Costs** – Do not change with output (e.g., rent, equipment)
- **Variable Costs** – Change with output (e.g., ingredients, labor)

### Total Cost
- **Total Cost** = Fixed + Variable Costs

### Average Cost
- **Average Cost** = Total Cost / Quantity Produced

---

## Economies of Scale

- As production increases, **average cost per unit falls**.
- Why?
  - Fixed costs are **spread over more units**.
  - Large firms can **mass-produce** and benefit from **specialization**.

### Example:
- Building one car is extremely expensive.
- Making 100,000 cars spreads the cost of equipment and labor → lowers average cost per car.

---

## Profit Maximization Rule

> **Produce where Marginal Revenue = Marginal Cost (MR = MC)**

- **Marginal Revenue (MR)** = Extra revenue from selling one more unit.
- **Marginal Cost (MC)** = Extra cost from producing one more unit.

- If **MR > MC** → Keep producing.
- If **MR < MC** → Stop producing.

---

## Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns

- Adding more variable inputs (like workers) to fixed resources (like ovens) **eventually yields lower additional output**.

### Example:
- 1 worker: 5 pizzas/hour  
- 2 workers: 20 pizzas/hour  
- 3 workers: 30 pizzas/hour  
- 4 workers: 33 pizzas/hour

- Eventually, adding more workers leads to **inefficiency** → Too many cooks in the kitchen!

---

## Sunk Costs

- A **sunk cost** is a **past cost that cannot be recovered**.
- Rational decision-making means **ignoring sunk costs** and focusing on **future costs and benefits**.

### Example:
- Spent $2 million developing a failed product? Let it go — that money is gone.
- Same applies to **personal decisions** (e.g., bad relationships).

---

## Final Takeaways

- **Economic principles help businesses** make broad decisions.
- For real-world execution, entrepreneurs need accounting, marketing, and management skills.
- Remember:
  - Revenue isn’t profit.
  - Costs include opportunity costs.
  - Marginal analysis is key to efficiency.
  - Ignore sunk costs in future planning.
