# Monopolies

## Introduction

- A **monopoly** is when one company dominates an entire market.
- They are often seen as **harmful** to consumers and competition — except in some cases where they are **more efficient** (e.g., public utilities).
- So, are monopolies good or bad? **Both**, depending on the context.

---

## Historical Context

- Monopolists like **Carnegie**, **JP Morgan**, and **Rockefeller** crushed competition in the 19th century.
- Rockefeller: “The growth of a large business is merely a survival of the fittest.”
- Economists typically value **competition** and see monopolies as its **opposite**.

## What is a Monopoly?

- A **pure monopoly**: One seller with a product that has **no close substitutes**.
- **Monopoly power** comes from preventing others from entering the market using **barriers to entry**.

---

## Barriers to Entry

- **Government regulation** (e.g., exclusive licenses)
- **Control of resources** (e.g., DeBeers controlling diamond mines)
- **High startup costs** (e.g., building a nuclear power plant)
- **Crony capitalism** – When businesses manipulate regulations for competitive advantage.

### Example: Food Trucks
- **Low barriers**: More competitors enter → consumer choice increases.
- **High barriers** (e.g., owning all licenses): Monopoly power is maintained.

## Oligopoly and Monopoly Power

- **Monopoly power**: Exists even if not 100% of market is controlled.
  - Example: Google dominates web search.
- **Oligopoly**: A few firms dominate a market.
  - Example: Android and iOS dominate mobile OS market.

## Anti-Trust Laws

- **Sherman Act (1890)**: Outlaws monopolization.
  - “No kings over production, transportation, or sale of necessaries.”
- **Enforced by**:
  - Department of Justice (DOJ)
  - Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
- **Types of integration**:
  - **Horizontal Integration**: Buying similar companies (e.g., AT&T trying to buy T-Mobile)
  - **Vertical Integration**: Owning the supply chain (e.g., Ford in the 1920s)

### Anti-Competitive Behavior
- **Microsoft**: Pressured PC manufacturers to install Internet Explorer.
- **Toys R Us**: Blocked suppliers from selling to competitors.

---

## Patents & Intellectual Property

- **Patents** create **temporary monopolies** to encourage innovation.
  - Example: Pharmaceutical companies recoup R&D costs.
- Patents expire (usually ~20 years) → competition enters → prices drop.
- Protected in the U.S. Constitution.

---

## Natural Monopolies

- Occur when one producer is **more efficient** than several competing ones.
  - Examples: **Water, electricity, sewage**
- **Economies of scale** reduce cost per unit when production increases.
- Usually **regulated by the government** to prevent price abuse.
- **Deregulation** example: AT&T was broken up in 1984.

---

## Price Discrimination

- Charging different consumers different prices for the **same product**.
- Earliest U.S. regulation targeted **railroad freight pricing**.
- **Legal** if based on willingness to pay and market separation.

### Examples:
- Airlines: Cheaper tickets for early bookers, expensive last-minute ones.
- Discounts: Based on age (e.g., seniors, students) or occupation.

- Price discrimination works best when:
  - The firm has **market power**.
  - There are **few substitutes**.
  - **Resale is difficult**.

---

## Conclusion

- **Monopolies** can harm competition and consumers but can also be **efficient** in specific scenarios (e.g., natural monopolies, patents).
- **Competition** is generally better, but not always.
- Economists and policymakers **balance** regulation and market freedom to protect innovation and consumer welfare.
