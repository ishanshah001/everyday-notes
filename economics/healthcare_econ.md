# Why Is Healthcare So Expensive?

## Introduction

- Healthcare is **unlike other markets**:
  - You can't plan when you'll need it.
  - In emergencies, price-shopping is not an option.
- Most people rely on **health insurance** (private or public) to cover unpredictable and high costs.

## How Healthcare Systems Work

### Common Models

1. **Canada** – *Single-payer system*:
   - Government funds healthcare through taxation.
   - Doctors often run private practices paid by the government.
   - Hospitals are publicly owned.

2. **France** – *Multi-payer system*:
   - All citizens must have insurance via non-profit insurance funds.
   - Most providers are private.

3. **UK** – *Socialized healthcare*:
   - Funded and controlled by government.
   - Providers are public employees; hospitals are public property.

4. **United States** – *Mixed system*:
   - Mostly private providers.
   - **Private insurance** for most under 65 (employer-based or individual).
   - **Public programs**:
     - **Medicare** (seniors)
     - **Medicaid** (low-income)
     - **VA** (veterans)

## Who's Covered in the U.S.?

- **2014 data** (Census Bureau):
  - **10.4% uninsured** (down from 13.3% in 2013).
  - **~66% private insurance** (mostly employer-sponsored).
  - **~33% public programs** (Medicare, Medicaid, VA, military).
- Some are counted in **multiple categories** due to switching insurers.

### The Uninsured

- More likely to be:
  - Young
  - Lower-income
  - Racially diverse
- Often work part-time jobs above Medicaid eligibility, but without employer coverage.
- Can be hit with **six-figure bills** in emergencies.

## Why Is U.S. Healthcare So Expensive?

### Cost per Person (2012)

- **U.S.:** $8,745 per person
- **Other rich countries:** $3,000–$6,000
- U.S. spends **more on Medicare alone** than many countries spend on total coverage.

### Contributing Factors

1. **Overuse of Services**:
   - Insurance coverage creates an **“all-you-can-treat”** mindset.
   - RAND study showed cost-sharing (like deductibles) reduces unnecessary care.

2. **High Prices**:
   - MRI: $1,500 in U.S. vs. $200–$400 elsewhere.
   - U.S. pays **3–5x more** for many services/procedures.
   - No unified negotiating body like in other countries.
   - Medicare/Medicaid get discounts; small insurers do not.

3. **Administrative Costs**:
   - Massive paperwork due to fragmented system.
   - Insurers and providers spend heavily on billing negotiations.

## What Drives Costs Most?

- **Quantity of care** is higher in the U.S., but **not drastically** more than other countries.
- **Administrative costs** are higher but explain only 10–20% of the difference.
- **Primary driver:** **Higher prices** paid to providers.

## Quality of U.S. Healthcare

- Mixed results:
  - **Higher rates** of hospitalizations for preventable conditions.
  - **More errors** in medications and lab work.
  - **Better outcomes** in heart disease and cancer detection/treatment.
- Quality doesn’t justify **double the spending**.

## Reform Challenges: The Iron Triangle

- **Iron Triangle** of U.S. healthcare politics:
  - **Congress** seeks reelection.
  - **Bureaucrats** protect jobs and funding.
  - **Lobbyists** protect special interests.
- Result: Policies often protect the status quo.

## The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)

### What It Did Not Do

- Did **not** create:
  - A government-run system (like UK)
  - A single-payer system (like Canada)

### What It Did

- Requires insurers to:
  - Accept all applicants
  - Charge same rates by age group
  - Cover pre-existing conditions
- Mandates everyone to have insurance or pay a fee.
- Subsidizes premiums for low-income households.

### Is It Working?

- **Access**: Improved—fewer uninsured Americans.
- **Cost**: Harder to evaluate; reforms include:
  - Cost-cutting incentives for doctors
  - Transparency requirements
  - Electronic records mandates
- **Quality**: Too early to tell definitively.

## Final Thoughts

- U.S. healthcare is:
  - **Complex**
  - **Expensive**
  - **Difficult to reform**
- **Government intervention** is debated:
  - Should it guide markets to be **fair, effective, efficient**?
- Obamacare reflects American ambivalence:
  - Distrust of both **big government** and **big corporations**
  - Reform increases regulation but preserves private sector role
