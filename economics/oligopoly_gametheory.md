# Oligopolies and Game Theory

## Market Structures Overview

- **Four types of markets**:
  1. **Perfect competition** – Many producers, identical products, easy entry (e.g., strawberries).
  2. **Monopolistic competition** – Many producers, low barriers, slightly differentiated products (e.g., fast food).
  3. **Oligopoly** – Few producers, high barriers, similar but not identical products (e.g., phones, airlines).
  4. **Monopoly** – One producer, high barriers, unique product.

## Characteristics of Oligopolies

- Dominated by a **few large companies**.
- **High barriers to entry** (e.g., cost, access to resources).
- Products often **similar but differentiated** (brand, service, style).
- Examples:
  - **Phones**: Apple, Samsung, LG.
  - **Laptops**: HP, Dell, Apple.
  - **Other markets**: Airlines, game consoles, candy, cars.

## Pricing in Oligopolies

- Firms have **some control over price**.
  - Example: iPhone vs. Android — not drastically different in price.
- **Too high a price** → Consumers switch to substitutes.
- Hence, they compete through **non-price competition**.

## Non-Price Competition

- Competing on:
  - **Style**
  - **Quality**
  - **Location**
  - **Service**
  - **Brand identity**
- Most visible form: **Advertising**
  - Helps differentiate products.
  - Common in oligopolies (e.g., car commercials).
  - **Rare** in monopolies (no competition) or perfect competition (identical products).

## Game Theory Basics

- **Game theory**: The study of strategic decision-making in competitive settings.
- **Key concept**: Firms consider **competitors' responses** when making decisions.

### Prisoner's Dilemma Example

- Two suspects interviewed separately.
- Best group outcome: **Both stay silent**.
- But both confess → **Worse combined outcome**.
- **Lesson**: Rational self-interest can lead to worse outcomes when there’s no cooperation.

## Game Theory in Markets

### Spatial Competition

- Vendors move closer to each other to steal customers.
- Result: **Converge in the middle**, share customers equally.

### Price Competition

- Lowering price → Competitor follows → Both make less profit.
- Therefore, firms often **maintain prices** and differentiate through **non-price competition**.

---

## Cartels and Collusion

- **Cartel**: Firms agree to limit competition, fix prices.
- **Collusion**: Illegal in the U.S. (violates antitrust laws).
  - **Cartels** raise prices and limit consumer choice.
  - **OPEC**: Legal international cartel controlling oil production and pricing.

### Price Leadership

- One firm changes price, others follow.
- Legal if there's no explicit agreement (unlike collusion).
- Example: Airlines adjusting baggage fees together.

## Payoff Matrix and Dominant Strategy

### Example

|                | Brandon High | Brandon Low  |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Stan High**  | 200 / 200    | 50 / 300     |
| **Stan Low**   | 300 / 50     | 80 / 80      |

- First number = Stan's profit, second = Brandon's.
- **Best collective outcome**: Both price high ($200 each).
- But **dominant strategy** for both is to price low.
  - Result: **Both price low** and earn only $80.
- Even with an agreement (cartel), firms may **cheat** to increase profit.

---

## Strategy and Innovation

- **Dominant strategy**: Best outcome regardless of competitor’s move.
- **Best response**: Optimal move in reaction to competitor’s choice.
- Many real-world situations have **no dominant strategy**.
- Firms must adapt or face obsolescence.
  - Examples of failure: Pan Am, Atari, Blackberry.

---

## Conclusion

- Oligopolies combine competition with cooperation — a **strategic balancing act**.
- **Game theory** helps explain pricing, advertising, and business behavior.
- **Healthy competition** leads to:
  - Better products
  - Lower prices
  - Innovation
- But without regulation, **collusion and price manipulation** can hurt consumers.
