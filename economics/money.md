# Money and Finance

## 1. What Is Money?

Money is **anything that functions as**:
1. **Medium of Exchange** ‚Äì Accepted for goods and services (avoids barter).
2. **Store of Value** ‚Äì Maintains value over time (unlike perishable goods).
3. **Unit of Account** ‚Äì Standardized way to measure value of goods/services.

> üí° Example: You don‚Äôt price a car in bananas. You use dollars because it‚Äôs a standard.

### Common Misconception:

## 7. How Lenders and Borrowers Connect

### 1. **Banks**
- Lenders deposit money ‚Üí bank loans it to borrowers
- Bank keeps some profit from interest, returns rest to depositors
- **FDIC**: Protects depositors in case of bank failure

### 2. **Bond Market**
- Governments or companies issue **bonds** (IOUs)
- Lenders buy them, receive:
  - Fixed interest payments
  - Repayment at maturity
- Bonds can be resold in open markets

### 3. **Stock Market**
- Companies sell **stock** (ownership slices) to raise money
- Shareholders:
  - May receive **dividends** (profits)
  - Can **sell stock** for capital gains

> Bonds = **Debt**  
> Stocks = **Equity**

## 8. Debt vs. Equity

| Feature          | Bonds (Debt)                          | Stocks (Equity)                         |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Payment Obligation | Fixed interest + principal            | No fixed payment ‚Äì depends on profits   |
| Risk             | Lower ‚Äì priority during bankruptcy     | Higher ‚Äì shareholders last in bankruptcy |
| Ownership        | No                                     | Yes ‚Äì partial company ownership         |

## 9. Why Not Just Lend Money Directly?

- **Risk**: You might lose all your savings if a borrower defaults.
- **Diversification**:  
  - Financial systems spread risk across many loans/investments.
  - You don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket.

> üìà Think of it as **Kickstarter + Risk Management**  
> You fund many ventures instead of just one.
