# Crash Course Economics: Why Are Some Countries Rich and Others Poor?

## 💰 Defining "Rich"

- GDP ≠ Wealth per person.
  - Example: India has higher total GDP than Singapore but far more people.
- **GDP per Capita** = GDP ÷ Population
  - More accurate for comparing countries' **standard of living**.
- High GDP per capita → Better outcomes:
  - Lower infant mortality, poverty, disease
  - Higher life expectancy, literacy, education
- **HDI** (Human Development Index) = Considers life expectancy, literacy, education, and quality of life.

## ❓ Why Are Some Countries Poor?

### 🚫 Common Misconceptions
- ❌ Lack of natural resources? Not always.
  - Example: Singapore (rich, few resources), Zimbabwe (poor, many resources).
- ❌ Racial/social Darwinist myths → Rejected.

### ✅ Key Factor: **Productivity**

> **Productivity** = Output per worker per hour.

- **Higher productivity** → Higher wages and living standards.
- Example:
  - US workers produce 18× more than Bangladeshi workers → Earn 18× more.
  - US GDP per capita is 8× what it was 100 years ago.

## 🧠 Thought Bubble: Donuts & Wages Example

- Worker making 12 donuts/hour → Can’t earn more than $12/hour.
- But if the worker produces 48 donuts/hour → Can earn more.
- More **output/hour** = More **earnings/hour**.

## ⚠️ Limitations of GDP per Capita

- **Productivity ≠ Equal incomes.**
  - Median wages may stagnate even as GDP per capita rises.
  - Links to **income inequality** (explored in future episodes).

## 🏭 Factors of Production

To be productive, countries need:
1. **Land** – Natural resources
2. **Labor** – Workers
3. **Capital** – Tools, machinery, infrastructure
4. **Human Capital** – Education, skills, experience

> Education builds **human capital**, which improves productivity.

## 🧠 Technology & Organizational Effectiveness

- **Technology** = How effectively resources are used.
  - Not just computers, but **better ideas** and systems.
- More capital increases productivity **but has costs**.
- Technology improves productivity **without needing more inputs**.

### 🖥️ Example: Computers
- Pre-1995: Computers were isolated tools.
- Post-1995: Internet-enabled productivity boom via **connectivity**.
  - Global supply chains, communication, and real-time coordination improved.

## 🌍 Global Productivity Trends

- Past 200 years: Gradual productivity gains → Major increases in standards of living.
- Recently, developing nations (e.g. China, South Korea, Ghana) boosted:
  - **Technology**
  - **Capital investment**
  - → Improved **living standards**

## 🏁 Key Takeaway

> **Why are some countries rich and others poor?**
>
> 🧩 **One-word answer: Productivity.**

- Productivity drives:
  - Wages
  - Output
  - Quality of life
- Long-term gains in productivity → Long-term gains in **standard of living**.
