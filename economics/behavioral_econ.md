# Behavioral Economics

## What Is Behavioral Economics?

- **Behavioral economics** is a subfield that examines how **psychological, emotional, and social factors** affect economic decision-making.
- **Adam Smith** discussed these ideas in *The Theory of Moral Sentiments* (1759).
- Traditional economics assumes **rational, informed consumers**, but behavioral economics acknowledges **bounded rationality** due to:
  - Limited information
  - Limited time
  - Cognitive/emotional limitations

---

## Rationality vs. Reality

- **Classical economics** assumes:
  - People are rational and predictable.
  - The law of demand holds: if prices go down, demand increases.

- **In reality**:
  - People may avoid low-priced goods due to perceived quality issues.
  - People are impulsive, emotional, and socially influenced.

### Analogy to Physics:
- Newtonian physics works for big objects, but breaks at the quantum level.
- Likewise, classical economics works well at macro level, but not always for individual decisions.

## Lack of Information

- **Perfect information** is assumed in classical economics, but often absent in reality.
- Example:
  - Low ice cream price may cause suspicion ("it might taste bad").
  - People use **limited or biased info** to make decisions.

---

## Prices and Perception

- **Price affects perception** of quality.
- **Wine experiment**:
  - Participants enjoyed wine more when they believed it was more expensive.
  - Same wine, different perceived price = different enjoyment.
  - Conclusion: **Marketing can affect "experienced pleasantness"**.

## Behavioral Finance

- **Asset bubbles** happen when investors act emotionally, not rationally.
  - Examples: Tulip Mania, 2008 housing crash.
- Keynes called it **"Animal Spirits"** — emotions that drive financial decisions.

---

## The Ultimatum Game

- Two players split $100.
  - Player 1 proposes a division.
  - Player 2 accepts → both get money.
  - Player 2 rejects → both get nothing.
- Classical theory says Player 2 should accept **any** money.
- But people often reject **unfair offers** (like $80/$20 split) due to:
  - Fairness
  - Justice
  - Revenge

---

## Framing Effect

- **Same facts**, different presentation = different decisions.
- Examples:
  - "75% fat free" vs. "25% fat"
  - "1 in 1000 wins" vs. "999 lose"
  - "Improve our Schools Act" vs. "Raise our Taxes Act"
- **Framing influences choices**, despite identical underlying information.

---

## Psychological Pricing

- Businesses exploit cognitive biases:
  - \$499.99 seems cheaper than $500.
  - "\$1 a day" sounds better than "$365 per year".
- **High-end stores** may use whole numbers to signal quality.

---

## Nudge Theory

- **Nudges**: Subtle changes in environment to influence behavior without eliminating choices.
- Example: Cafeteria layout
  - Healthy food placed at eye level → increased consumption.
  - Works because people take the easy option, not always the best one.

---

## Risk and Loss Aversion

- **Risk attitude** measured by choices between:
  - Envelope A or B (50/50 chance of \$0 or $100)
  - Guaranteed $50
- People who take less than $50 to avoid risk are **risk-averse**.

### Loss Aversion

- **Losses hurt more** than gains feel good.
- Example:
  - Coin flip: Heads = +\$100, Tails = -$50 → many still avoid risk.
- People are **more motivated to avoid loss** than to achieve gain.

---

## Real-World Applications

### Bag Tax Example

- **Reward**: 5¢ for reusable bags → little change in behavior.
- **Penalty**: 5¢ tax for plastic → large drop in use.
- **Conclusion**: People respond more to **penalties (loss)** than **rewards (gain)**.

### Employee Bonus Study

- Group A: No bonus.
- Group B: Bonus at year-end if goals met.
- Group C: Bonus given **up front**, with condition to **repay if goals not met**.
- **Group C outperformed** → people hate losing what they already have.

---

## Conclusion

- **Behavioral economics** adds realism to economic models by including emotion, social norms, and perception.
- Humans aren't always rational actors.
- Understanding behavioral tendencies can improve:
  - Business strategies
  - Public policy
  - Economic predictions
