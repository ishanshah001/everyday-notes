# Monetary Policy

## 1. What Is Monetary Policy?

- **Monetary Policy** is the process by which a central bank controls the money supply to influence the economy.
- In the **U.S.**, this is done by the **Federal Reserve (The Fed)**.
- Other examples:  
  - **ECB (European Central Bank)**  
  - Similar institutions exist in other countries.

## 2. Core Roles of Central Banks

| Function                                | Explanation                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Regulation & Oversight**              | Ensure banks hold adequate reserves to prevent bank runs.                   |
| **Monetary Policy**                     | Increase or decrease the **money supply** to stabilize the economy.         |

## 3. Interest Rates & the Money Supply

### What Is an Interest Rate?
- The **price of borrowing money**.
- Includes:  
  - **Principal**: the original loan amount  
  - **Interest**: % fee to account for inflation and lender profit

### Relationship Between Interest Rates and the Money Supply

| Action by the Fed                      | Effect on Money Supply | Effect on Interest Rates | Result                    |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Increase Money Supply (Expansionary)   | Increases               | Decreases                 | More borrowing & spending |
| Decrease Money Supply (Contractionary) | Decreases               | Increases                 | Less borrowing & spending |

## 4. Types of Monetary Policy

| Policy Type           | Goal                            | Method                     |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Expansionary**        | Stimulate a sluggish economy     | Increase money supply → lower interest rates |
| **Contractionary**      | Slow down inflation              | Decrease money supply → raise interest rates  |

## 5. Real-Life Examples

| Period                  | Action Taken                   | Outcome                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Post-9/11 (2001)**     | Fed increased money supply     | Lowered interest rates → economy recovered slowly |
| **Late 1970s**           | Inflation ~13%                 | Fed decreased money supply → raised rates, reduced inflation but increased unemployment |
| **Great Depression**     | Fed failed to act              | Banks collapsed due to lack of liquidity and confidence |

---

## 6. What Went Wrong During the Great Depression?

- The Fed allowed **major banks to fail**, causing:
  - Loss of confidence
  - Massive **bank runs**
  - Collapse of **⅓ of all banks**
- They failed to:
  - Provide **emergency liquidity**
  - Increase the money supply

---

## 7. How Does the Fed Change the Money Supply?

### 1. **Reserve Requirement**
- Minimum % of deposits banks must keep.
- Lowering it → more loans → increases money supply  
- Raising it → fewer loans → decreases money supply

### 2. **Discount Rate**
- Interest rate the Fed charges banks to borrow money.
- Lowering it → easier to borrow → increases money supply  
- Raising it → discourages borrowing → decreases money supply

### 3. **Open Market Operations (OMO)**
- The Fed **buys or sells short-term government bonds** (Treasury bills).
- Buying bonds → gives cash to banks → **increases money supply**  
- Selling bonds → takes cash from banks → **decreases money supply**
- **Most frequently used method**

---

## 8. Quantitative Easing (QE)

- Used during **2008 financial crisis** when interest rates hit near-zero.
- Fed bought **long-term assets** (e.g., **Mortgage-Backed Securities**) in addition to Treasury bonds.
- Injected **"made-up" money** into the economy to stimulate lending.
- Concern: **Risk of inflation** due to increased money creation.

## 9. Why Didn’t QE Cause Massive Inflation?

| Possible Explanation                     | Reason |
|------------------------------------------|--------|
| **Banks held excess reserves**           | Money didn’t enter the economy via loans |
| **Stricter lending regulations**         | Reduced borrowing |
| **Public fear after housing crash**      | People avoided borrowing |
| **Foreign demand for dollars**           | Strengthened U.S. currency |
| **Slow economic recovery**               | Kept inflation subdued |

---

## 10. When Will the Fed Raise Interest Rates?

- As the economy recovers, the Fed will reduce the money supply.
- This **raises interest rates** to prevent the economy from overheating.
- Classic metaphor:  
  > "The Fed takes away the punch bowl just as the party’s getting started."

## 11. Monetary Policy vs. Fiscal Policy

| Policy Type     | Controlled By            | Tools Used                             | When Most Effective               |
|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Fiscal**        | Government (Congress)     | Taxes and Government Spending           | Severe recessions (e.g. 2008)       |
| **Monetary**      | Central Bank (The Fed)    | Money Supply and Interest Rates         | Regular fluctuations, quicker to enact |

---

## 12. Final Thoughts

- **Janet Yellen** (former Fed Chair) had enormous influence due to her role in guiding monetary policy.
- **Good monetary policy** depends on:
  - Economic conditions
  - Independence of central bank from politics
- Most economists agree:  
  - For minor ups and downs → **monetary policy**  
  - For major crises → **both fiscal & monetary**
