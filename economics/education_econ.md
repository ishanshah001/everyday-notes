# The Economics of Education

## Overview
- Education is often **government-funded**, but nothing is truly free — it has **opportunity costs**.
- People and societies invest in education for both **individual** and **public benefits**.
- In the U.S., education is facing **rising costs**, **inequality**, and **debate** about funding and reform.

## Why Governments Fund Education

### Positive Externalities
- Education benefits both the **individual** and **society**:
  - Higher income and employment
  - Innovation and productivity
  - Social contributions (e.g. civic participation, public health)
- Markets may **underprovide education** if left alone.
- Therefore, **government investment** is justified.

## U.S. Public Education System

- **\$634 billion** spent in 2015 on K–12 education (~$12,500 per student).
- Still, **inequality persists**:
  - Students from low-income families score lower and are more likely to drop out.
  - Racial disparities in dropout rates remain significant.

### Solutions Proposed by Economists
1. **Increase public funding** — especially for early education and disadvantaged students.
2. **Introduce competition** — through charter schools, vouchers, and open enrollment.
3. **Incentivize teachers** — reward based on performance and student outcomes.

## Is College Worth It?

### The Financial Upside
- **College graduates earn more**:
  - Avg. salary (25–32 y/o):  
    - College grads: **$45,000**  
    - High school grads: **$28,000**
- **Lower unemployment** rates for college grads:
  - College: **~3%**
  - High school only: **~5.4%**
  - No high school diploma: **~8.6%**

### But Wait — It’s Not That Simple
- **Selection bias**: College grads often come from more advantaged backgrounds.
- Not all gains are due to college *itself*.

## Why Do College Grads Earn More?

### Two Theories

1. **Human Capital Theory**  
   - College teaches **marketable skills** that increase productivity and earnings.

2. **Signaling Theory**  
   - A degree **signals ability**, discipline, and socio-economic background to employers.
   - Degrees differentiate applicants when interviews can’t.

➡️ **Evidence supports both theories**.

## Rising Costs and Student Debt

### Student Loan Facts
- U.S. student loan debt: **>$1 trillion**
- In 2012:
  - **~70%** of students took loans
  - Median debt: **$27,000**
  - (1993 median: **$12,500**)

### Why the Debt?

- **Tuition is up**:
  - Public 4-year colleges:  
    - 1994: ~$10,600 → 2014: ~$18,900  
  - Private universities:  
    - 1994: ~$26,500 → 2014: ~$42,400  
  - (*All inflation-adjusted*)

- But **"sticker price" ≠ actual cost**:
  - Most students get **financial aid**, scholarships, or grants.
  - **Net tuition increase** is more modest.

### Other Contributors
- **For-profit colleges**: Higher debt burden for students.
- **Graduate school enrollment** is rising.
- **Luxury amenities** and **administrative costs** at universities are increasing.

## The Risk of Not Finishing

- Only **~50%** of college enrollees graduate within 6 years.
- **Worst debt outcomes** are often for students who borrow but don’t finish.

---

## Alternatives to 4-Year College

- **Skilled trades** can pay well:
  - Mechanic: ~$40,000  
  - Plumber: ~$50,000  
  - Electrician: ~$55,000
- Demand for these roles may **increase** as older workers retire and fewer youth enter trades.

---

## Final Thoughts

- **Is college worth it?** → It depends.
  - On where you go.
  - What you study.
  - How much you pay.
  - And your goals in life.

- **Education is not just a private investment**, it's a **public good**.
  - More education can help **reduce poverty** and **address inequality**.

> Education pays off — but only with the right planning, policies, and personal decisions.
