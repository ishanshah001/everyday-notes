# Income & Wealth Inequality

## Types of Economic Inequality

### 1. **Wealth Inequality**
- **Wealth** = assets - liabilities.
- Includes savings, stocks, real estate, pensions.
- Represents how assets are distributed.

### 2. **Income Inequality**
- **Income** = new earnings added to wealth.
- Represents how new money is distributed.

> They are related but distinct forms of inequality.

## Global Wealth & Income Distribution

- Global wealth ≈ $260 trillion.
- **North America & Europe**: <20% of population, **67% of wealth**.
- **China**: more population than NA + Europe, but **only 8% of wealth**.
- **India & Africa**: ~30% of population, **only 2% of wealth**.

### Global Income Distribution (per $100):
- Richest 20% → $83
- Next 20% → $10
- Middle 20% → $4
- Second-poorest 20% → $2
- Poorest 20% → **$1**

## Causes of Inequality

### 1. **Industrial Revolution**
- Created a huge income gap between countries.
- In 1820: richest countries ≈ 3x richer than poorest.
- Today: richest ≈ **100x richer**.

### 2. **Globalization**
- Helped billions out of poverty.
- But disproportionately benefited the **very rich**.

### 3. **Skill-Biased Technological Change**
- Tech complements **skilled** workers, replaces **unskilled** ones.
- Leads to:
  - **Rising returns** for high-skilled workers.
  - **Stagnation** or **decline** for low-skilled.

## Education & Poverty

- In the US (last 30 years):
  - College grads in poverty: 3% → 6%
  - HS grads in poverty: 6% → **22%**
  - College grad salaries ↑, HS grad wages ↓ (adjusted for inflation).

## Other Contributing Factors

- Decline of unions.
- Tax policies favoring the wealthy.
- Massive CEO-to-worker pay ratios.
- Structural inequality: race, gender, etc.

## Measuring Inequality

### Lorenz Curve
- Visualizes income distribution.
- Straight line = perfect equality.
- Real curve = reality of unequal distribution.

### GINI Index
- 0 = perfect equality, 100 = perfect inequality.
- **US** has highest GINI among Western nations.
- **UK** has highest in the EU.

## Is Inequality a Problem?

### View 1: Not Necessarily
- Everyone may be earning more, but at **different rates**.
- Rich just gain faster.
- Example: You get 4 apples from 10, then 5 from 20—more apples, but smaller share.

### View 2: Yes, It’s Harmful
- Income inequality is linked to:
  - Higher **violence**, **drug abuse**, **incarceration**.
  - Diluted **political equality**.
  - Rich promote policies that protect their wealth.
- **Bill Gates**: Inequality is inherent in capitalism, but there’s a threshold where it becomes **damaging**.

## Solutions & Policy Options

### Common Proposals:
- **Improve education access and quality**.
- **Raise minimum wage**.
- **Affordable childcare** to support working parents.
- **Social safety nets** (welfare, unemployment benefits).
- **Tax code adjustments** to redistribute income.

### Tax Policy Ideas:
- Increase top **income tax rates** to 50–60%.
- Close tax **loopholes** used by the wealthy.
- **Capital gains taxes** reform.

### Alternate View:
- Focus on reducing **regulation and bureaucracy** to boost economic participation.

## Final Thoughts

> "No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable."  
> — **Adam Smith**

- Whether motivated by **empathy** or **fear of unrest**, income inequality must be addressed.
- The debate isn’t whether inequality exists, but **what to do about it**.
