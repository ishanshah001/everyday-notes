# 📈 Inflation, Bubbles, and Tulips

## 🔑 What is Inflation?

- Inflation = A sustained **increase in the overall price level** in an economy.
- **Purchasing Power** = The amount of goods/services your money can buy.
  - If prices rise faster than your income, purchasing power **falls**.
  - A 2% raise with 5% inflation = **real income falls by 3%**.
  - Rising prices = same as **cut in wages**, and vice versa.

## 💰 Measuring Inflation

### 🛒 Consumer Basket
- Economists create a **"market basket"**: a sample of what typical consumers buy (e.g. rent, gas, bread, movie tickets).
- They measure the **total cost** of that basket year after year.

### 📊 CPI – Consumer Price Index
- Formula:  
  \[
  \text{CPI} = \left( \frac{\text{Basket Cost in Year X}}{\text{Basket Cost in Base Year}} \right) \times 100
  \]
- CPI tracks how prices change over time.

## 💵 Nominal vs. Real Prices

- **Nominal Price** = Not adjusted for inflation.
- **Real Price** = Adjusted for inflation (more accurate for comparisons).

> Economists use **real values** to compare things like wages, GDP, and box office earnings over time.

---

## ❌ Limitations of CPI

- Doesn't capture:
  - **New products**
  - **Quality improvements**
- Example: TVs from the 1950s vs. modern flat screens.
- Adjustments are made for technological changes, but it’s complex.

## 🌍 Global Inflation Rates

| Country/Period | Trend |
|----------------|-------|
| **US (1950–today)** | Inflation slow → fast in 70s/80s → slow again |
| **Japan (last 25 yrs)** | **Deflation** – prices falling slightly |
| **Venezuela (2014)** | **Hyperinflation** – ~70% annual inflation |

## 🔍 What Causes Inflation?

### 💸 Demand-Pull Inflation
- “**Too much money chasing too few goods**”
- Example: Everyone wants pizza, they bid up prices.

### 💥 Cost-Push Inflation
- Input costs rise (e.g. oil), making production more expensive.
- Fewer goods produced → prices increase.

> **Inflation occurs when there's more money than available goods/services.**

---

## Case Study: Venezuela

- Once a wealthy, oil-rich country.
- **Mismanagement + political instability** → reduced oil exports.
- Government printed more money → **massive inflation**.
- Shows **natural resources ≠ economic stability**.

---

## 📈 Rising Prices ≠ Always Inflation

- Some price increases are due to **supply & demand**, not general inflation.

### 🍫 Chocolate Prices
- Demand: ↑ in China + global dark chocolate trend.
- Supply: ↓ due to drought/disease.
- Result: Prices ↑ (but not inflation—just a **market shift**).

### 🏠 Housing Prices (2000–2006)
- Demand increased due to:
  - Low interest rates
  - Loose lending (e.g. NINJA loans: **No Income, No Job, No Assets**)
- Rising prices → **speculation**
- Everyone assumed prices would keep rising → **Bubble formed**

---

## 🫧 Understanding Bubbles

### 🏡 Housing Bubble
- Prices detached from fundamentals.
- Speculators bought homes to sell for profit.
- Eventually, new buyers ran out → **Bubble burst**.

### 📉 Internet Bubble (Late 1990s–2000)
- Massive investment in unprofitable tech companies (e.g. pets.com).
- Stock prices soared → crashed in 2000.

### 🌷 Tulip Mania (1630s – Netherlands)
- Tulips = Luxury fad among wealthy.
- Prices skyrocketed (some bulbs = 12 acres of land).
- Bubble burst → tulips now worth <$1.

> Bubbles form when people irrationally believe prices will keep rising forever.

## 🧠 Why This Matters to You

- Inflation affects **real wages**.
- Understanding economics helps in:
  - Negotiating raises
  - Saving/investing smartly
  - Identifying bubbles or financial risks

## 📚 Examples to Remember

- 🎬 *Gone With the Wind* vs *Avatar* box office → Real vs Nominal
- 🏠 Housing market pre-2008 → Classic Bubble
- 🍫 Chocolate prices → Supply/Demand shift, not inflation
- 🌷 Tulip Mania → Earliest known economic bubble
