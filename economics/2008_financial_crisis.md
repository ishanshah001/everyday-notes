# The 2008 Financial Crisis

## Overview

- The **2008 Financial Crisis** nearly caused a global economic collapse.
- Triggered by a housing market bubble, poor financial regulation, and risky investments.
- The U.S. government’s response included **bailouts**, **stimulus**, and **financial reform**.

---

## Understanding Mortgages

- A **mortgage** is a loan to buy a house, repaid monthly with interest.
- Traditionally, only borrowers with good credit could get mortgages.
- Banks **sold mortgages** to other institutions (they didn’t always keep them).
- This separation between **lender** and **risk holder** became problematic.

---

## Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)

- Banks **bundled mortgages together** and sold them to investors as **MBS**.
- These securities promised steady returns based on homeowners’ payments.
- MBS looked safe because:
  - Home prices were rising.
  - Borrowers were expected to repay.
  - **Credit rating agencies** rated them **AAA** (very safe).

---

## Subprime Lending & the Bubble

- To create more MBS, lenders **lowered standards**:
  - Approved loans to people with **low income** and **poor credit**.
  - Offered **adjustable-rate** loans with low initial payments that ballooned.
  - Used **predatory lending** practices.

- These were called **subprime mortgages**.

- As demand for MBS grew, so did risky lending.

---

## The Bubble Bursts

- Borrowers **defaulted** when they couldn’t pay their rising mortgage payments.
- **Home prices fell** → people owed more than their homes were worth.
- More **defaults** → more foreclosures → **further price drops**.
- Subprime lenders and investors holding MBS **lost billions**.

---

## More Risky Instruments: CDOs & Swaps

- **CDOs (Collateralized Debt Obligations)**:
  - Bundles of mortgage-backed assets, including **risky subprime loans**.
  - Still received high ratings despite being dangerous.

- **Credit Default Swaps (CDS)**:
  - Insurance on MBS — but **unregulated** and **unfunded**.
  - Companies like **AIG** sold millions in CDS without having the funds to pay out.

- These instruments created a complex, **interconnected web of risk**.

---

## Systemic Collapse

- Major firms like **Lehman Brothers** went bankrupt.
- Credit markets froze. The stock market crashed.
- Uncertainty in the system paralyzed the global economy.

---

## Government Response

### Federal Reserve:
- Offered **emergency loans** to banks to restore confidence.

### TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program):
- \$700B authorized, $250B used to **bail out banks**, automakers, AIG, and homeowners.

### Stress Tests:
- Assessed large banks to restore transparency and confidence.

### Stimulus Package (2009):
- $800B+ in **spending** and **tax cuts** to revive demand and jobs.

---

## Dodd-Frank Act (2010)

- Major financial regulation reform to increase oversight.
- Key Provisions:
  - **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau**: Prevent predatory lending.
  - **Transparency for derivatives**: Required public exchanges.
  - **Orderly liquidation**: Controlled process for big banks to fail.

> But debates continue on whether Dodd-Frank is sufficient to prevent another crisis.

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Perverse Incentives**
- Mortgage brokers were paid to issue loans — even risky ones.

### 2. **Moral Hazard**
- Lenders took risks because they didn’t bear the full cost.
- Belief in "Too Big to Fail" encouraged **reckless behavior**.

> *If banks expect bailouts, they’re more likely to take dangerous bets.*

---

## Who’s to Blame?

- **Government**: Failed to regulate properly.
- **Regulators**: Over-relied on the market’s ability to self-correct.
- **Credit Rating Agencies**: Overrated risky assets.
- **Financial Institutions**: Took on too much risk.
- **Individual Borrowers**: Took on loans they couldn’t afford.

## Final Thought

> *"The fault lies not in the stars, but in us."*  
> – Paraphrased from Shakespeare in the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission Report.

The crisis wasn’t a fluke. It was a **systemic failure** of a system built and run by people, driven by **greed, denial, and poor oversight**.
