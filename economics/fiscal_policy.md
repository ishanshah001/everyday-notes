# Fiscal Policy

## 1. Introduction
- **Fiscal Policy** is a legitimate, government-led method to correct economic fluctuations.
- It involves **adjusting government spending and taxation** to influence the economy.

---

## 2. Business Cycle and GDP Gaps

- **Potential GDP**: The maximum sustainable output of an economy.
- **Actual GDP** fluctuates due to economic cycles.

### Two key types of gaps:
| Type of Gap        | Description                                                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Recessionary Gap** | Actual output < Potential GDP → unemployment, idle factories |
| **Inflationary Gap** | Actual output > Potential GDP → low unemployment, high prices |

- Unsustainable inflationary gaps lead to price increases without real output gains.

---

## 3. Real-World Trends
- U.S. GDP since 1920 shows ups and downs (booms & busts).
- **The Great Moderation (1980s–2000s)**: Reduced fluctuations.
- **2008 Financial Crisis**: Triggered the Great Recession, ending the moderation.

## 4. Consequences of Gaps

| Problem         | Impact                                                        |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **High Unemployment** | Economic damage, social issues (suicide, domestic violence) |
| **High Inflation**    | Loss of savings, social unrest, protests, riots           |

---

## 5. Fiscal Policy Overview

- Used to **influence aggregate demand** via:
  - **Government spending**
  - **Taxation**

| Policy Type               | When it's used                    | What it does                         |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Expansionary Fiscal Policy** | During a recession                 | Increases spending, reduces taxes     |
| **Contractionary Fiscal Policy** | During inflationary gaps           | Reduces spending, raises taxes        |

- **U.S. fiscal policy** decisions are made by **Congress and the President**.

---

## 6. Expansionary Fiscal Policy

- **Goal**: Boost spending and output during recessions.
- **Methods**:
  - Increase government spending (e.g. infrastructure projects)
  - Decrease taxes (increase disposable income)

### Example: 2009 U.S. Stimulus
- **American Recovery and Reinvestment Act**:
  - ~$800 billion stimulus
  - 60% spending, 40% tax cuts
  - Created jobs in construction, education, energy

---

## 7. Contractionary Fiscal Policy

- **Goal**: Cool off overheating economy and reduce inflation.
- **Methods**:
  - Decrease spending
  - Increase taxes

- Rarely used due to political consequences:
  - E.g. George H. W. Bush raised taxes → lost 1992 election

---

## 8. The Fiscal Policy Debate

### Classical View:
- Economy **self-corrects** in the long run.
- Government intervention leads to **inflation or debt**.
- Believed recessions would resolve naturally via:
  - Lower wages
  - Lower resource prices

### Keynesian View:
- Introduced by **John Maynard Keynes**.
- Government spending can **replace lost private sector spending** during recessions.
- Quote: “In the long run we are all dead.”

---

## 9. Deficit Spending and Debt

- Governments can't raise taxes to fund stimulus (defeats purpose).
- So they **deficit spend**: spend more than they collect in taxes.
- Leads to borrowing → **national debt**.

### Criticism: Crowding Out
- Government borrowing raises interest rates → private sector investment drops.
- **Keynesian Response**:
  - Crowding out matters only if economy is at full capacity.
  - If idle resources exist, government spending can increase overall output.

## 10. Global Comparison: U.S. vs. Europe (Post-2008)

| Metric            | United States (Stimulus) | Eurozone (Austerity) |
|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Average GDP Growth | 2.5%                      | -1%                  |
| Unemployment Rate | 5.5%                      | 12%                  |

---

## 11. The Multiplier Effect

- **Multiplier**: How much total spending results from $1 of government spending.

### How it works:
- Gov spends $100 → worker spends $50 → musician spends $25 → etc.
- Ripple effect increases total economic activity.

| Condition                    | Approx. Multiplier |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| Economy at full capacity    | ~1                 |
| Recession with idle resources | ~2               |

---

## 12. Multiplier Differences by Policy

| Policy Type                         | Multiplier Estimate | Notes |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------|-------|
| Welfare & unemployment benefits     | High (close to 2)    | Spent quickly by low-income groups |
| Infrastructure projects             | ~1.5                 | Effective but slower to implement |
| General tax cuts (e.g. payroll)     | ~1                   | Fast, but not always spent |
| Targeted tax credits (e.g. wealthy) | <1                   | High-income individuals may save |

- Ideal policy: **fast-acting** with **high multiplier** (often hard to achieve both).

## 13. Summary

| Concept                        | Explanation |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| **Fiscal Policy**             | Government adjustment of spending/taxes to influence economy |
| **Expansionary Policy**       | Used during recessions (stimulus) |
| **Contractionary Policy**     | Used during inflation (rarely applied) |
| **Multiplier Effect**         | Amplified impact of spending on overall economy |
| **Crowding Out**              | Risk of private investment falling due to gov borrowing |
| **Keynesian Economics**       | Advocates gov action in recessions |
| **Austerity**                 | Policy of reducing gov spending to cut debt |

## 14. Final Thoughts

- Fiscal stimulus can be powerful **when done right**, especially during downturns.
- But it's not a magic wand — requires timing, careful planning, and tradeoffs.
- Confidence plays a big role in recovery.
- Fiscal policy is likely here to stay, barring major ideological shifts.
