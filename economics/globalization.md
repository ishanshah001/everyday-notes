# Globalization, Poverty, and Development

## What Is Globalization?

- **Globalization** refers to the increasing interconnectedness of global economies, cultures, and populations through trade, communication, and technology.
- It enables goods, services, labor, and ideas to move more freely across borders.

## Poverty and Global Goals

- **Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)** were set by the UN in the 1990s to improve global conditions by 2015.
  - Goal #1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger.
  - Extreme poverty = living on less than **$1.25/day** (UN definition).
- **Progress**:
  - 1990: 1.9 billion in extreme poverty.
  - 2015: 836 million.
  - **Projected** < 400 million by 2030 (assuming continued improvements).
- **Threat**: Climate change could undermine progress.

## Globalization and Its Impacts

### Positive Impacts

- **Technology leapfrogging**: e.g., mobile phones in rural areas improve education, market access, and finance.
- **Export opportunities**: Developing countries can sell products/labor in global markets.
- **Job creation**: Increases income and demand in local economies.
- **Example**: Bangladeshi apparel industry sustains millions of jobs with wages above local alternatives.

### Negative Impacts

- **Job outsourcing**: Manufacturing jobs move from high-wage to low-wage countries.
- **Hazardous conditions**: Weak labor laws, lack of regulation.
- **Environmental degradation**: Deforestation, pollution, and climate change from expanded production.
- **Unequal benefits**: Corporations and wealthy countries profit most.

---

## Opposing Views on Globalization

- **Critics**:
  - Call it **economic colonialism**.
  - Demand higher wages and labor/environmental protections.
  - Push for **protectionist policies** (tariffs, job restrictions).
- **Supporters**:
  - Argue that **participation in global trade**, even in poor conditions, is better than exclusion.
  - Wages often better than alternatives.
  - As economies grow, **labor competition increases** â†’ better pay and working conditions.

---

## Regulation and Ethical Trade

- **Lack of enforcement** in many developing countries:
  - No minimum wage
  - Weak safety/environmental standards
  - Child labor still exists despite global bans
- **Public pressure** helps:
  - Example: U.S. publishes list of goods linked to child/forced labor.
  - Companies face backlash if sourcing from unethical suppliers.

---

## Sustainability Challenges

- As more people join the global middle class, consumption rises (cars, meat, electronics).
- The planet may not be able to sustain this consumption without serious environmental impact.
- Globalization must balance **economic progress** with **ecological limits**.

---

## Microcredit: Economic Empowerment from Below

- **Microcredit** = small loans (avg. ~$100) to low-income individuals, especially women.
- **Muhammad Yunus**, founder of Grameen Bank, won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize.
- Loans used for:
  - Starting small businesses
  - Generating sustainable income
- **Impact**:
  - Boosts participation in the economy on personal terms.
  - Not a cure-all, but a powerful support mechanism.
  - Reinforces idea: **Access to opportunity is key.**

---

## Final Thoughts

- Globalization has **lifted millions out of extreme poverty**, but often into difficult or exploitative work conditions.
- **Economists call it progress**, but it's progress with trade-offs.
- The future challenge:
  - **Uplift the poor** while ensuring sustainability and equity across global systems.
