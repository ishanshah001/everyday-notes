# Environmental Economics

## Overview
- Economics is about choices and resource allocation.
- It also applies to **conserving** resources, not just consuming.
- Environmental economics studies how to balance economic growth with environmental protection.

## Pollution as a Market Failure

- **Pollution** (especially CO₂ emissions) is a form of **market failure**.
- The **market produces more pollution** than is socially optimal.
- **Negative externalities**: The full cost of pollution isn’t paid by the polluters.
- Climate change is a result of accumulating greenhouse gases (GHGs) like CO₂.

---

## Simple Economic Framework

1. **Identify pollution sources**:
   - Factories, vehicles, fossil fuel-based energy production.

2. **Reduce supply** of polluting goods or **decrease demand** for them:
   - Not easy due to reliance on cheap fossil fuels and global coordination problems.

---

## Challenges

### Tragedy of the Commons
- No one owns the atmosphere → countries have **little incentive** to reduce pollution.
- Countries fear acting alone if others continue polluting.
  
### Fossil Fuel Dominance
- Markets have made fossil fuels **cheap and dominant**.
- Renewable energy is still not cheap enough to fully compete.

---

## Policy Solutions

### 1. **Government Regulation**
- Direct limits on pollution levels or pollution-causing behavior.
- Example: Emissions standards, chemical bans.

### 2. **Price Incentives**
- **Taxes** on gasoline or carbon emissions.
- **Subsidies** for:
  - Electric cars
  - Solar and wind energy
  - Energy-efficient technologies

### 3. **Cap and Trade (Permit Markets)**
- Government **sets a pollution limit** (cap).
- Firms **buy and sell permits** to pollute.
- Incentivizes firms to **reduce emissions** to sell unused permits.
- Balances environmental goals with economic flexibility.

### 4. **Technology Subsidies**
- Funding green energy R&D to make alternatives **cheaper and more viable**.
- Example: U.S. investment through American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009).

## Current Renewable Energy Status

- As of 2014:
  - **10%** of U.S. energy from renewables.
  - Global average also ~10%.
- By 2040:
  - Estimated to reach **15%** globally.
- Issue: Still not cost-competitive without help.

---

## The Rebound Effect

### What Is It?
- **Energy efficiency** can lead to **increased usage**.
  
### Example:
- Hank buys a fuel-efficient car:
  - Uses less gas → saves money.
  - Might drive more → **offsets some environmental gains**.
  - Lower demand → cheaper gas → others consume more.

### Key Insight:
- Behavioral response matters!
- Economists must consider **how people respond to incentives**.

---

## Global Action and Hope

- Most countries now acknowledge the problem.
- Actions:
  - **UN Climate Treaties**
  - **Private sector** investments
  - **Research funding** for clean tech (e.g., China leads in renewable investment)

---

## Individual vs Collective Responsibility

- Reusable grocery bags aren’t enough.
- Real impact comes from:
  - Insulating homes
  - Adjusting thermostats
  - Investing in clean infrastructure

### Bottom Line:
- **Industries, governments, and individuals must work together**.
- It’s a **shared responsibility** — collective action is essential.
