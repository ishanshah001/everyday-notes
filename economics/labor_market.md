# Labor Markets and Minimum Wage

## Introduction

- Labor markets determine how much people are paid.
- Factors influencing wages:
  - Skill set
  - Demand for those skills
  - What others are getting paid
- Labor markets are shaped by **supply and demand**, but are also affected by **regulations and market imperfections**.

## Labor Markets and Wages

### Example: Cristiano Ronaldo

- Makes ~$20 million/year playing football (soccer).
- High salary due to:
  - Low supply of world-class athletes.
  - High demand from fans, sponsors, and teams.
- Even if he'd play for less, Real Madrid pays more due to **revenue generation** and competition.

---

## Supply and Demand in Labor Markets

- **Labor market roles**:
  - Workers **supply** labor (sellers).
  - Employers **demand** labor (buyers).

### Voluntary Exchange

- Wages are determined through negotiation:
  - Too high → employer hires someone else.
  - Too low → worker finds a better offer.
- Wage must at least cover **opportunity cost** (lost time or other potential income).

### Derived Demand

- Demand for labor depends on demand for the product/service.
  - Example: More pretzel sales → more pretzel workers needed.

## Wage Differences Between Professions

- **High wages**: Engineers (high demand, low supply).
- **Low wages**: Social workers, historians (lower demand, higher supply).
- Key concept: **Supply and demand** explain wage variation.

## When Wages Deviate from Market Equilibrium

### 1. Wage Discrimination

- Workers may be paid less based on:
  - Race, sex, age, ethnicity, etc.
- **Not based on productivity**.

### 2. Monopsony

- A market with **only one employer**.
- Workers lack mobility; wages are suppressed.
- Example: NCAA athletes generate huge revenue but are restricted to scholarships.

### 3. Efficiency Wages

- Employers pay **above-equilibrium wages** to:
  - Increase productivity
  - Improve employee retention
- Example: Henry Ford doubled factory wages in 1914.

### 4. Labor Unions

- Represent workers' interests.
- Use **collective bargaining** to raise wages/improve conditions.
- Power has declined:
  - 1950s: 1 in 3 workers unionized
  - Now: ~1 in 9, mostly in public sector

## Minimum Wage

### What Is It?

- **Minimum wage** = price floor
- Prevents wages from falling below a legal minimum.

### Effects

- Technically affects \<3% of U.S. workers.
- **Ripple effect**: Can raise wages for ~30% of the workforce.
- Controversial:
  - Supporters: Corrects market failures, combats employer power.
  - Opponents: Causes unemployment, especially among low-skilled workers.

---

## Classical Economics View

- Government interference (like minimum wage) distorts markets.
- May **hurt unskilled workers**:
  - Employers avoid hiring them
  - Could lead to **zero wage** (unemployment)

---

## Support for Minimum Wage

- Real labor markets aren't always competitive.
- Employers often have **more bargaining power**.
- Minimum wage may correct **market failures**, not distort competitive markets.

### Analogy:
- Like **antitrust laws** prevent monopolies, minimum wage laws prevent employer exploitation.

---

## International Context

- Most countries have minimum wage laws or **de facto** minimums via union agreements.
- Disagreement remains about:
  - **How high** the minimum wage should be
  - Its **economic impact**

---

## Case Studies

### 1. New Jersey vs. Pennsylvania (1992)

- NJ raised wage from \$4.25 to \$5.05; PA stayed at $4.25.
- Result: Employment **increased** in NJ fast food restaurants.
- Conclusion: Minimum wage **didn't cause job loss** in this case.

### 2. University of Chicago Survey

- Majority believe:
  - Raising minimum wage to $9/hour could hurt job availability.
  - **But** many think benefits to those who stay employed **outweigh** job loss.

---

## Final Thoughts

- **Minimum wage won't eliminate poverty**, but may **reduce** it.
- Complementary policies are needed:
  - **Education and skill development** are key to higher wages.
- While debates continue, one solution is to **gain valuable skills** that are in **high demand**.
