## Title: Introduction to Economics

---

## Definition of Economics
- **Economics** is the study of **people and choices**.
- It focuses on how individuals and societies use **limited resources** to satisfy **unlimited wants**.

> **Alfred Marshall’s Definition**:  
> Economics is “a study of man (and woman) in the ordinary business of life… a study of wealth and, more importantly, of man.”

---

## What Economics is NOT
- Not just about **money**, **wealth**, or **getting rich**.
- Not about the **stock market**.
- Not limited to **forecasting trends** in suits or predicting recessions.

---

## Key Assumptions in Economics
1. **Scarcity**:  
   - Resources are limited, but wants are unlimited.  
2. **Opportunity Cost**:  
   - The value of the next best alternative foregone when a decision is made.

> **Example**: Watching Crash Course instead of watching cat videos. The opportunity cost is the cat videos.

---

## Core Concepts
- **Trade-offs**: Choosing one thing means giving up something else.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Weighing the cost and benefit of every decision.
- **Rational Decision-Making**: People make choices to maximize their satisfaction or benefit.

---

## Examples of Economic Decision-Making
- A student choosing between work and college.
- A business deciding whether to produce phones or tablets.
- A government choosing between building roads or increasing defense.

---

## "Guns vs. Butter" Trade-Off
- Nations must choose between:
  - **Guns (military goods)**  
  - **Butter (consumer goods)**
- Scarcity forces a decision between competing priorities.

> **Quote – Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953)**:  
> “Every gun that is made... signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed.”

---

## Incentives
- **Definition**: Motivation that encourages a person or institution to act.
- Correct incentives lead to better outcomes.
- **Badly designed incentives** lead to **perverse results**.

> **Example**:  
> In colonial Vietnam, a bounty on rats led people to cut off tails and release rats to breed more. The policy backfired.

> **Analogy**:
