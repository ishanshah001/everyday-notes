# Price Controls, Deadweight Loss, and Subsidies

## Overview
- Why governments set price controls during inflation/deflation
- Why **price ceilings and price floors often fail**
- How **deadweight loss** results from inefficient allocation
- The role and criticisms of **subsidies**
- When subsidies might improve efficiency

## Price Controls

### What Are Price Controls?
- Government-imposed limits on how high or low a price can be.
- Two types:
  - **Price Ceiling**: Maximum legal price
  - **Price Floor**: Minimum legal price

---

## Price Ceilings

### Definition
- Government sets a **maximum price** below equilibrium to make goods more affordable.

### Example: Gasoline Price Ceiling
- If gas costs \$3/gallon at equilibrium, and the government sets a ceiling at $1:
  - **Quantity demanded increases**
  - **Quantity supplied decreases**
  - Results in **shortage**
  - Leads to **deadweight loss** (inefficient resource use)

### Other Examples
- **Venezuela**: Price ceilings on essentials led to shortages and halted production.
- **Rent Control** (e.g., NYC, SF):
  - Caps rent to keep housing affordable
  - Long-term tenants benefit
  - But landlords:
    - Have less incentive to build or maintain housing
    - Result: housing **shortage** and quality issues

### Economic Viewpoint
- Economists widely agree: **price ceilings reduce both quantity and quality**
- Only affect markets **when set below equilibrium**

---

## Price Floors

### Definition
- Government sets a **minimum price** above equilibrium to support producers.

### Example: Corn
- Equilibrium price = \$4/bushel, but floor set at $7:
  - Farmers supply more
  - Consumers buy less (switch to substitutes like rice)
  - Results in **surplus** and **deadweight loss**

### Economic Viewpoint
- Inefficient and wasteful unless addressing exceptional cases
- Long-term market distortion

---

## Deadweight Loss

- Occurs when the market fails to produce at the optimal (equilibrium) quantity
- Caused by price controls:
  - **Price ceilings**: underproduction
  - **Price floors**: overproduction
- Reduces **allocative efficiency**
- Graphically: area between supply and demand curves that represents lost value to society

---

## Government Alternatives to Price Floors: **Subsidies**

### What Are Subsidies?
- **Government payments** to individuals or businesses
- Intended to:
  - Lower costs
  - Promote production
  - Achieve social or policy goals

### Example: Subsidizing Strawberries
- Increases supply
- Lowers prices
- Keeps market near **equilibrium**
- Avoids shortages/surpluses
- Helps with:
  - Food price stability
  - Ensuring adequate food production

### Economic Criticisms
- Many farmers are not low-income
- **Guaranteed income discourages innovation**
- Encourages **overproduction**
- Encourages farming on less fertile land (risk-taking)
- 85% of surveyed economists say **U.S. should eliminate agricultural subsidies**

## U.S. Agricultural Subsidy History

### Great Depression Era
- Agricultural Adjustment Act (1933):
  - Paid farmers **not** to grow crops
  - Government **bought surplus**
  
### 1990s Onward
- Introduced **direct payments**:
  - Based on land ownership and historical output
  - Paid **regardless of current production**
- 2005: $25 billion in farm aid (more than welfare spending)
- $1.3 billion went to **non-farmers**
- 2014: **Direct payments eliminated**, but $20B/year still spent
  - Mostly on **crop insurance**

---

## When Do Economists Support Subsidies?

### The Case for Subsidies
- If a good provides **external benefits** not captured in market prices
- Market underproduces the good → **deadweight loss**
- Subsidy **increases output** → improves efficiency

### Example: Renewable Energy
- Without subsidies:
  - Underdevelopment of solar, wind, etc.
- With subsidies:
  - Encourages innovation
  - Increases production
  - Reduces inefficiency

### The Counter-Argument
- Markets **already incentivize innovation**
- Subsidies create **false demand**
- May cause long-term inefficiencies

## Key Takeaways

1. **Markets work** to allocate resources and set prices efficiently.
2. **Price controls** (ceilings and floors):
   - Create shortages/surpluses
   - Cause **deadweight loss**
   - Often **harm those they intend to help**
3. **Subsidies** can help in specific cases (e.g., renewables, R&D)
   - But are often **misused** or inefficient
4. Government action can be justified
