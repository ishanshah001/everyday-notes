# Crash Course Economics: Trade Deficits, Exchange Rates, and International Trade

## What is International Trade?

- International trade = exchange of goods/services across borders.
- **Exports**: Goods produced domestically and sold abroad.
- **Imports**: Goods produced abroad and purchased domestically.
- The U.S. is:
  - The **largest importer** (e.g., oil, cars, clothes).
  - The **second-largest exporter** (e.g., jets, pharmaceuticals, corn, movies).

## Net Exports and Trade Balance

- **Net Exports = Exports − Imports**
  - If exports > imports → **Trade Surplus**
  - If imports > exports → **Trade Deficit**
- In 2014, the U.S. had a **trade deficit** of $722 billion.

## Are Trade Deficits Bad?

- Not necessarily.
- The U.S. imports clothing because other countries can produce it more cheaply (comparative advantage).
- Consumers save money on imports, which they spend elsewhere in the economy (e.g., entertainment, restaurants), creating jobs.
- Trade shifts jobs across sectors, but:
  - **Not all jobs are equal**: Factory jobs may pay more than service jobs.
  - **Short-term pain** vs **long-term efficiency**.

## NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement)

- Enacted in 1994: reduced trade barriers between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.
- **Critics**:
  - Increased U.S. trade deficits.
  - Reduced U.S. manufacturing jobs.
- **Supporters**:
  - Boosted overall economic growth.
  - Lowered consumer prices.
  - Created jobs in other sectors.

## Protectionism vs. Free Trade

- **Protectionism** = high tariffs and trade restrictions.
  - Often hurts domestic economies by increasing prices and reducing efficiency.
- **World Trade Organization (WTO)** promotes trade liberalization and resolves disputes.
  - Criticized for favoring wealthy countries and ignoring labor/environmental concerns.

## Exchange Rates

- **Exchange rate** = value of one currency in terms of another.
- Example: 15 pesos = 1 USD.
  - U.S. tourist needs 4 USD to buy 60 pesos of sunscreen.
  - If exchange rate rises to 20 pesos/USD → 3 USD needed for same sunscreen (USD appreciated).
  - Mexican tourist now needs more pesos to buy USD goods (USD exports become more expensive).
- **Appreciation**:
  - Domestic imports ↑
  - Domestic exports ↓
- **Depreciation**:
  - Domestic imports ↓
  - Domestic exports ↑

## Floating vs Pegged Exchange Rates

- **Floating exchange rates**: Adjust with supply/demand (e.g., USD, peso).
- **Pegged exchange rates**: Managed by central banks (e.g., China's yuan previously pegged to USD).
  - China kept the yuan artificially low to maintain export competitiveness.

## Balance of Payments

- A record of all a country's economic transactions with the rest of the world.
- Two main components:
  - **Current Account**: Tracks trade in goods/services, investment income, foreign aid.
  - **Financial Account**: Tracks financial flows like stock, bond purchases, and asset sales.
- Trade deficit → Financial inflows:
  - U.S. buys goods → Foreign countries receive dollars.
  - They use dollars to buy U.S. goods (exports) or U.S. financial assets (stocks, bonds).

## Summary: Trade-Offs and Consequences

- Trade improves global living standards in the aggregate.
- But it redistributes jobs, income, and industry within a country.
- **Winners and losers** emerge.
- Economic models assume self-interested actors, but real outcomes can be uneven.
- Trade policy must balance **efficiency** with **equity** and **national priorities**.
