## A Brief History of Economic Thought

### Thomas Malthus (1798)

- Argued that helping the poor was immoral.
- Economically and morally discredited.

## Adam Smith and Classical Economics

### Adam Smith (1776) — *The Wealth of Nations*
- Individuals pursuing self-interest unintentionally serve the common good.
- Advocated for free markets and trade.

### David Ricardo
- Developed the theory of **comparative advantage**:
  - Even if one nation is more efficient at everything, both nations can benefit from trade by specializing.

### Classical Economics
- Championed private property, free markets, and limited government.
- Formalized by Alfred Marshall in *Principles of Economics* (1890):
  - Introduced concepts like **supply and demand**, **marginal utility**, etc.

## Karl Marx and Communism

### Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels — *The Communist Manifesto* (1848)
- Focused on class struggle between workers and property owners.
- Predicted the fall of capitalism and rise of **communism**:
  - A **stateless**, **classless** society based on collective ownership.

### Das Kapital

## Keynesian Economics

### John Maynard Keynes — *The General Theory* (1936)
- Challenged classical economics after the Great Depression.
- Argued that:
  - Prices and wages adjust slowly.
  - Government must intervene to boost demand in recessions.
- Advocated for:
  - **Monetary policy** (interest rate changes)
  - **Fiscal policy** (government spending and taxation)

### Impact
- Laid the foundation for **macroeconomics**.
- Influenced policy responses to economic downturns.

## Socialism

- Grew alongside Keynesian economics.
- Supports:
  - Markets and private property (in many cases)
  - Government regulation
  - Public ownership in key industries
  - Strong welfare programs (e.g., universal healthcare)

### Examples
- Scandinavian countries (e.g., Norway, Sweden)
- U.S. policies include Keynesian stimulus, but less emphasis on socialism.

## Austrian School

### Key Figures: Friedrich Hayek, Ludwig von Mises
- Opposed government intervention.
- Believed economies are too complex to manipulate.
- Advocated for:
  - Free markets
  - Minimal regulation
  - No fiscal or monetary intervention

---

## Chicago School

- Extended Austrian skepticism of intervention.
- Argued:
  - Government policy worsened the Great Depression.
  - Privatization and deregulation are preferable.
- Advocated:
  - School vouchers
  - Limited government role in economy

### Monetarism
- Emerged from the Chicago School.

- Advocated:
  - **Tax cuts**, especially for corporations and high earners
  - **Deregulation**

## New Neoclassical Synthesis

- Combines insights from:
  - **Classical economics**
  - **Keynesian economics**
  - **Monetarism**
- Forms the basis of **mainstream economic thought** today.

---

## Ongoing Debates

- Economic ideologies impact real lives, not just academic theory.
- Reactions to the 2008 global recession included:
  - **Keynesian** stimulus (deficit spending)
  - **Austerity** (cutting public spending)
- Economists still debate which approach works best and when.

---

## Conclusion

- History shows that **economic ideas evolve** — often after major crises.
- Many once-communist countries have shifted toward capitalism.
- Most economies today are hybrids, incorporating ideas from multiple schools.
- Predicting the future is difficult, but **ideas will continue to shape history**.
