## Free Market vs Central Planning

### Centrally Planned Economies
- Government decides what and how much is produced.
- Aims to fulfill society's collective goals.
- Issues:
  - Inefficiency
  - Shortages of consumer goods (e.g. soap, electronics)
  - Emphasis on heavy industry (e.g. tractors, military equipment)
  - Lack of feedback on consumer preferences

### Free Market Economies
- Prices determined by supply and demand.
- Producers respond to consumer behavior.
- Incentivizes efficiency and innovation.

---

## Types of Efficiency

### Productive Efficiency
- Goods are produced at **lowest possible cost**.
- No waste of resources (labor, materials, machines).
- Free market businesses are motivated by **profit**, unlike central planners.

### Allocative Efficiency
- Resources are allocated toward goods that **consumers actually want**.
- Example:
  - A firm producing only skinny jeans may be productive but **not allocative** if consumers want boot cuts too.

---

## Price Signals

- **Prices convey information** about what consumers value.
- High prices = consumers want more = producers make more.
- Low prices = less demand = producers shift to other goods.

### Example: Tablets
- iPad created demand for tablets.
- Competitors (Samsung, Google) entered the market due to high price signals.
- Prices help allocate goods to those who value them most.

---

## Gift Giving and Efficiency
- Joel Waldfogel argued gift giving can be **economically inefficient**:
  - People may not value the gifts they receive.
  - Wastes resources compared to giving **cash**, which ensures allocative efficiency.
- However, gifts also offer **social value** (relationships, affection).

---

## The Invisible Hand and Market Adaptation

- In free markets, producers must meet consumer demands or go out of business.
- **Competition** helps regulate price and quality.
- **Adam Smith’s "invisible hand"**: individuals seeking profit benefit society by producing what people want.

---

## Government Role and Market Regulation

- The U.S. is not a pure free market:
  - Heavily regulated in many sectors.
  - FDA regulations (e.g., rodent pellet limits in wheat).
  - Direct control in defense and education.
- **Public economics** studies when and how government should intervene to improve welfare.

---

## Price Gouging

### Definition
- Sellers drastically increase prices during emergencies (e.g., for food, gas, water).

### Debate
- **Critics**: unethical and exploitative.
- **Economists**: raising prices encourages:
  - Suppliers from outside to bring in goods.
  - Efficient allocation (only those who truly need the items will buy them).
- **Laws**: 34 U.S. states have anti-price gouging laws.
- **Private incentives** can also reduce gouging:
  - Good public image and long-term profits matter.
  - Example: Walmart’s disaster preparedness (emergency ops center, in-house meteorologist).

---

## Predatory Pricing

### Definition
- Large firms temporarily lower prices below cost to drive out competition.
- Once rivals exit, they raise prices.

### Example: Walmart
- Accused in multiple lawsuits.
- Uses scale to undercut smaller businesses.
- **U.S. Courts** generally reject predatory pricing claims due to lack of long-term profitability.
- In **Germany**, Walmart was ordered to raise prices and eventually exited the market.

### Risks
- Long-term strategy may fail:
  - New competitors may enter once prices go up.
  - Market share gains may not offset earlier losses.

---

## Are Markets Evil?

- Markets can reflect greed, inequality, and environmental harm.
- However, **capitalism is not inherently unethical**.
- **Conscious capitalism** exists:
  - Firms can do good and make profits.
  - Consumers play a key role through their choices.

---

## Consumer Responsibility

- Every purchase is a **vote** for what and how things get made.
- If you disagree with a company's ethics, **don’t buy from them**.
- Expect more from corporations and from ourselves as consumers.

### Ethical Consumption
- Choosing ethical products may require:
  - Paying more
  - Buying less
- Markets can support social values **without** central planners.
- Our **individual choices** shape societal priorities.

---

## Inequality and Privilege

- It's a **luxury** to choose based on conscience.
- Many people globally cannot afford to pay higher prices for ethical goods.
- Efficiency must be balanced with **empathy and accessibility**.
